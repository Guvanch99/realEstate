  "whyWe": "The best real estate websites are polished and human. The agent should be front and center but content should be focussed on helping potential buyers and sellers.They’re designed to generate leads but they don’t use invasive pop-ups or demand visitors give up an email address to access content. Instead they are calm and available for whenever the visitor is ready to get in touch.\n\nGreat real estate websites know the best form of marketing is education. So they provide resources to help potential buyers and sellers. Photography is deeply important to real estate on the web.\n\nThere are conventional features— real estate search, current properties, neighborhood guides— but almost every realtor website has these. The real way to differentiate is by educating and being human.",
  "clientComment": "Always available, extremely knowledgeable, and a tremendous \"can-do\" attitude. Our company was on a tight timeline and strict budget to create a first-class mobile interpretation app, and Will was the perfect partner. His guidance and advice was invaluable in producing that app which easily exceeded my expectations... the entire company was thrilled with it! Without any hesitation... highly recommended.",
